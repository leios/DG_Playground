The reason why there is usually just one place that kappa changes values of diffusivity has to do typical physical scenarios that arise in the ocean / atmosphere. The ocean interior is stably stratified as there is no appreciably strong convection. In the ocean cooling comes from the surface of the ocean and leads to mixing that starts in the upper ocean and progresses towards the ocean abyss. The solution to linear systems of this form (when Delta t becomes large), is essentially constant in the region of high diffusivity.","category":"page"},{"location":"#DG_Playground-1","page":"Home","title":"DG_Playground","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"#","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"A repository for quickly prototyping ideas ideas for the [CLIMA] project.
