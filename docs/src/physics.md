# Physics

The operators in [ClIMA](https://github.com/CliMA/ClimateMachine.jl) come from various physical scenarios that we model with a simplified set of equations. The models that we will discuss here are typically motivated by various forms of [turbulence closures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbulence_modeling) or [parameterizations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parametrization_(atmospheric_modeling)).
