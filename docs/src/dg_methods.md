# Discontinuous Galerkin

In [CLIMA](https://github.com/CliMA/ClimateMachine.jl) the [Discontinuous Galerkin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discontinuous_Galerkin_method) method serves as our spatial discretization method. It may be thought of as a combination of spectral methods and finite volume methods. The method is a higher-order generalization of a finite volume method.
